      - The ABC's of programming helped me gain an idea on how JavaScript functions as a whole. I learned the different pieces that structure a webpage including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Each element is different and does something different in order to make the browswer render webpages. JavaScript is one of the most commonly used languages in the world. 
      - A few key points that stuck out to me was different functions of JavaScript itself. For example, what an object is and how a computer classifies an object. And how we can use JavaScript to describe and "build" the object. JavaScript also uses the "top down" method which breaks the information into smaller pieces as we go from top to bottom. Starting with the variable and working your way down through functions and methods. Lest not forget, arguments.
