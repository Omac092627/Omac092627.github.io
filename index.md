     - Java Script:
         
         Evaluations: You can analyze values in a script to determine the expected results.
          
          Decisions: Using results of evaluations you can determine which path your script goes down.

          Loops: perform some steps repeatedly.
          
          When using Decision Making you want to use flow charts.
          
          Evaluating conditions and conditional statements: 2 components to a decision:
          
            An expression is evaluated, which returns a value.
            
            A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.
      Example:
      
          Comparison operators: <,>,*,!=,===
          
          Logical operators: &&, ||, !
          
          Switch Statements: can pass multiple cases (variables) through one statement, basically only runs when called.
          
            Example: Switch(level) {
                      case 'One':
                       title = 'level1';
                       break; (this stops the code from running)
                       
          If statements: if you need to compare values to get a result.
          
            Example: if(score>50) {
                      congratulate();
                      }
                        else {
                        encourage();
                        }
       - HTML:
          Structural markup: describe headings and paragraphs.
          
          Semantic markup: used for emphasis.
          
          h1: main heading
          
          h2: subhead
          
          h3: smaller
          
          Example: <p></p>: paragraph
          
          Example: <b></b>: bold
          
          Example: <i></i>: italicized
          
          Example: <sup></sup>: super script 2 to the second power
          
          Example: <sub></sub>: sub script: CO2
          
          white space: makes it easier to read
          
          Example: <br />: break up a paragraph
          
          Example: <hr />: horizontal line break: a liter line
          
          Example: <strong></strong>: makes words bold like
          
          Example: <em></em>: emphasis: italicized like
          
          Example: <blockquot></blockquote>: a proper way to cite because it works with IE
          
          Example: <q></q>: quote, but doesn't work on IE
          
          Example: <abbr></abbr>: abbreviation
            Example: <abbr title= 'professor'> prof </abbr>
          
          Example: <cite></cite>: how to cite work
          
          Example:<dfn></dfn> = define something
          
          Example: <address></address>: physical address or phone number or email etc
          
          Example: <ins></ins>:insert
          
          Example: <del></del>:delete
          
          Example: <s></s>: something is no longer relevant but remains in the script
          
        . CSS:
        
            External CSS:
            
              <link>: tell browswer where css is, goes in the head
              
              href: specifies path to folder
              
              type: type of document
              
              rel: relationship to file
              
                Example: <link href="CSS/Styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheets"/>
          
          Internal CSS:
          
              <style></style>
          
          CSS Selectors:
          
            Universal Selectors: applies to all elements in the document: *{}
            
            type selector: matches element names: h1, h2, h3 {}
            
            class selector: matches class with period: .note{}
            
            ID Selector: #introduction {}
            
            Child Selector: li>a{}
            
            Descendant Selector: p a {}
            
            adjacent sibling selector: h1+p {}
            
            general sibling selector: h1~p {}

      - The ABC's of programming helped me gain an idea on how JavaScript functions as a whole. I learned the different pieces that structure a webpage including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Each element is different and does something different in order to make the browswer render webpages. JavaScript is one of the most commonly used languages in the world. 
     
     - A few key points that stuck out to me was different functions of JavaScript itself. For example, what an object is and how a computer classifies an object. And how we can use JavaScript to describe and "build" the object. JavaScript also uses the "top down" method which breaks the information into smaller pieces as we go from top to bottom. Starting with the variable and working your way down through functions and methods. Lest not forget, arguments.
