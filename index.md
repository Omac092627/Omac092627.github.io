      Javascript: Chapter 4 Decisions and Loops

Type coercision: Javascript runs data behind the scenes.

Falsy: values are teated as if false

truthy: values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table is true.

unary operator: returns a result with just one operand.

Loop checks a condition, if true a block of code will run.

For loop: if you need to run your code a specific number of times.

While loop: if you don't know how many times you need your code to run. The condition doesn't have to be a counter, it will run as long as needed.

Do while loop: is same as a while loop but always runs code in the brackets one time.

Loop counter:

Initialization:
  Create a variable and set it to 0
  var i = 0

Condition:
  i < 10
  Loop should run until counter reaches number

Update:
  i++
  every time the loop runs you add one to the counter.


HTML: Boxes, Borders, Padding

Box Dimensions:
  width, height

Limiting width:
  smallest size the box is shaped

Border: every box has a border
Margin: outer edge of border
Padding: space between border of box and what's in it
Border-width: thick, medium, thin
Border-style: solid, dashed, double
Border-color: any
Padding: space between content and border
Margin: controls gap between boxes
Border-radius: round corner boxes 80px 50px

     - Java Script:
         
         Evaluations: You can analyze values in a script to determine the expected results.
          
          Decisions: Using results of evaluations you can determine which path your script goes down.

          Loops: perform some steps repeatedly.
          
          When using Decision Making you want to use flow charts.
          
          Evaluating conditions and conditional statements: 2 components to a decision:
          
            An expression is evaluated, which returns a value.
            
            A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.
      Example:
      
          Comparison operators: <,>,*,!=,===
          
          Logical operators: &&, ||, !
          
          Switch Statements: can pass multiple cases (variables) through one statement, basically only runs when called.
          
            Example: Switch(level) {
                      case 'One':
                       title = 'level1';
                       break; (this stops the code from running)
                       
          If statements: if you need to compare values to get a result.
          
            Example: if(score>50) {
                      congratulate();
                      }
                        else {
                        encourage();
                        }
       - HTML:
          Structural markup: describe headings and paragraphs.
          
          Semantic markup: used for emphasis.
          
          h1: main heading
          
          h2: subhead
          
          h3: smaller
          

          
        . CSS:
        
            External CSS:
            
              <link>: tell browswer where css is, goes in the head
              
              href: specifies path to folder
              
              type: type of document
              
              rel: relationship to file
              
                Example: <link href="CSS/Styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheets"/>
          
          Internal CSS:
          
              <style></style>
          
          CSS Selectors:
          
            Universal Selectors: applies to all elements in the document: *{}
            
            type selector: matches element names: h1, h2, h3 {}
            
            class selector: matches class with period: .note{}
            
            ID Selector: #introduction {}
            
            Child Selector: li>a{}
            
            Descendant Selector: p a {}
            
            adjacent sibling selector: h1+p {}
            
            general sibling selector: h1~p {}

      - The ABC's of programming helped me gain an idea on how JavaScript functions as a whole. I learned the different pieces that structure a webpage including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Each element is different and does something different in order to make the browswer render webpages. JavaScript is one of the most commonly used languages in the world. 
     
     - A few key points that stuck out to me was different functions of JavaScript itself. For example, what an object is and how a computer classifies an object. And how we can use JavaScript to describe and "build" the object. JavaScript also uses the "top down" method which breaks the information into smaller pieces as we go from top to bottom. Starting with the variable and working your way down through functions and methods. Lest not forget, arguments.
