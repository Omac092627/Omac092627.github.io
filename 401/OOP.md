Referring to the readings from earlier this week. I feel like I understand Unit Testing a lot better now. Pretty much my whole weekend has been invested in doing this past weeks assignments and I've learned so much. Unit Testing helped me better understand parameters of method signatures. Really interesting stuff. Also, I know Big O, it's somehow stuck in my head lol.
