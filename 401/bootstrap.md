Azure DevOps provides developer services to support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Developers can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services or on-premises using Azure DevOps Server. Azure DevOps Server was formerly named Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS).

Azure DevOps provides integrated features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client. You can use one or more of the following services based on your business needs:

Azure Repos provides Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source control of your code
Azure Pipelines provides build and release services to support continuous integration and delivery of your apps
Azure Boards delivers a suite of Agile tools to support planning and tracking work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods
Azure Test Plans provides several tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing and continuous testing
Azure Artifacts allows teams to share Maven, npm, and NuGet packages from public and private sources and integrate package sharing into your CI/CD pipelines
You can also use collaboration tools such as:

Customizable team dashboards with configurable widgets to share information, progress, and trends
Built-in wikis for sharing information
Configurable notifications
Azure DevOps supports adding extensions and integrating with other popular services, such as: Campfire, Slack, Trello, UserVoice, and more, and developing your own custom extensions.

For information on the differences between the cloud versus on-premises platforms, see Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server.

Microsoft renamed Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to Azure DevOps Services. For more information about this change, see Introducing Azure DevOps.

Team Foundation Server became Azure DevOps Server 2019.
