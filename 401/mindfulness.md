1. Deliberate Practice -- The Fastest Way to Improve Your Skills
      -  by Erik Hamre

            Deliberate practice is the most effective method to rapidly improve any skill, and consists of intense, structured practice on essential aspects of the task being mastered.

             The activities are designed for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.

             Your goal is to extend your body and mind, and push yourself beyond the current limits of your capacity.

             And to engage so deeply in a task that you leave the training session a changed person.

            
            Characteristics of Deliberate Practice

                Deliberate practice is characterised by the following traits:

                The practice takes place outside one’s comfort zone and requires a learner to constantly try things that are just beyond his or her current abilities.

                The practice involves well-defined, specific goals and often involves improving some specific aspect of the target performance. It is not aimed at some vague overall improvement.

                The practice requires your full attention and conscious actions. It is not enough to be at practice and simply follow the instructions of a coach. You must concentrate on the specific goal of the practice and make conscious adjustments to try and achieve it.

                The practice involves feedback and modifications of efforts in response to that feedback. In the beginning, most of the feedback will come from a coach, but as you progress, learners must learn to monitor themselves, spot mistakes, and adjust accordingly.

                The practice usually involves building or modifying previously acquired skill by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working on improving a very specific part.


                The term ‘deliberate practice’ was defined by the psychology professor Anders Ericsson, the world leading expert on expertise and high level performance. He claims these four criteria must be fulfilled to call it deliberate practice:

                You must be motivated to attend to the task and exert effort to improve your performance.
                The design of the task should take into account your pre-existing knowledge so that the task can be correctly understood after a brief period of instruction. The activities are at an appropriate, challenging level of difficulty.
                You should receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of your performance.
                You should repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks.

                Your speed of progress depends mainly on the quality and intensity of each practice session, multiplied by the time you practice.
                To achieve this level of practice, it’s required to be very committed to what you do.        


            My Synopsis: The article was a great read. My takeaway was understanding that there is even more to just practicing something. Deliberate practice is focusing on what you're practicing on and improving your skill in order to practice the next step in reaching the ultimate goal. Which could take up to 10,000 hours, if you're not practicing correctly that is.

    - Carol Dweck


                    YET - is a powerful word that was used by a highschool if they didn't pass a certain class. Instead of saying you "failed". Saying you haven't passed YET, is much more powerful. 

                    Before using yet, there are a host of porblems. Comparing yourself to other people grades, anger/sadness from not passing, and so on. 

                    Praise "YET":
                        Praise the process
                        Praise effort, strategy, and progress. 

                    Changing students mindsets in the process. 

            My Synopsis: The video by Carol Dweck was informative and inspiring. I was the student who would always worry if I wasn't doing as well as my counterparts. Instead of looking at things as a failure, it's just that I haven't made it yet.


3. Ideas Worth Spreading:

                    Grit - Is a marathon and not a sprint. It is the initiative in which you keep going regardless of the outcome. 

                    Grit matters for those who aren't as confident in themselves. 

                    We don't know very much about grit.

                    Grit is inverse to talent.

                    GROWTH MINDSET: The belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, you can change yourself.

                    Failure is very important.

            My Synopsis: Grit follows Carol Dweck's philosophy on changing the way we learn as humans. Failure is important to success. It is literally the driving force. However, those who don't persevere, aren't doomed, they just need grit.

4. A kinder, gentler philosophy of success 
    - Alaine De Botton

            Part of the reason of our suffering is that we're surrounded by snobs. Global phenomenon. = Takes a small part of you and assumes they know everything about you.


            It's not material goods we want it's the reward.

            Save judgement as you don't know someone's value.

            Failure, fear of judgement.

            First society to think very highly of ourselves. 

            You can't be successful at everything.

            Our idea of success is not our own. It's created by someone else. 

            My Synopsis: Success is complicated. If you spend your life judging yourself by the success you haven't had, you'll miss out on the opportunity to view the actual success of what you've already done. Patience is needed to attain success, because you can't be successful at everything.


5. Imposter Syndrome Pt. 1/2
    - Dr. Sarah

            Everyone suffers from imposter syndrome. 

            Good methaphor about the chip bag. Where you feel like an empty chip bag before doing your chosen profession but then when you've been doing it for a while you feel like a full chip bag. Or can of beans. 

            Self care and recognizing your problems before they arise. Mindfulness patterns to help you create a calm enviornment. 


            Imploy values into imposter thoughts. 

            Value assets help cope with imposter syndrome.

            Betting that your imposter thoughts are incorrect. 

        My Synopsis: I thought the podcasts did a good job at giving anecdotes in order to help the listeners. Or me. Both women speaking are incredibly accomplished, went to prominent universities and still felt like they weren't good enough. I thought these stories helped me understand that we all go through the same issues and there are ways to cope with not feeling like you're good enough. 


6. How to think like a programmer
    - Richard Reis

            Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

            1. Understand
                Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

                How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

                Do you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn’t see before?

                Most programmers know this feeling.

                This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).

            2. Plan
                Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

                Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

                In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

                To get a good plan, answer this question:

                “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

                Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!


            3. Divide
                Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

                Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

                Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

                Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

                After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

                Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

                Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

                This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).

                “If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’
                For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.
                If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?
                Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul


                4. Stuck?
                    By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”

                    First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

                    Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

                    The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

                    In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

                    Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
                    “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer
                    Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
                    “Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level. […]
                    The classic example of this, of course, is the summation of a long list of consecutive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n, which a very young Gauss quickly recognized was simply n(n+1)/2, thus avoiding the effort of having to do the addition.” — C. Jordan Ball
                    Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.

                    Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).
                    Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.



                    Practice
                        Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

                        Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”

                        How to practice? There are options out the wazoo!

                        Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….

                        In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.

                        “Byron Reeves said ‘If you want to see what business leadership may look like in three to five years, look at what’s happening in online games.’
                        Fast-forward to today. Elon [Musk], Reid [Hoffman], Mark Zuckerberg and many others say that games have been foundational to their success in building their companies.” — Mary Meeker (2017 internet trends report)
                        Does this mean you should just play video-games? Not at all.

                        But what are video-games all about? That’s right, problem-solving!

                        So, what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).

                        For example, I enjoy coding challenges. Every day, I try to solve at least one challenge (usually on Coderbyte).

                        Like I said, all problems share similar patterns.

                My Synopsis: In order to be a good programmer you need to be a good planner. The idea is to understand the problems as oppose to the syntax. I originally thought you should know the syntax, but I was wrong, I need to know how the problem works.







7. Pretend your time is worth 1000 dollars
    - Anthony Moore

                “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness
                “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
                It takes discipline to not become “busy.”
                If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
                This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.
                We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins:
                “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”


                “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

                “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”


                “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”

                You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them
                
                
                “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet

                “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”


            My synopsis: Time is incredibly valuable and putting a price on it is an effective way to change perception on how I view it. I personally don't spend all my time as I should and this article really opened my eyes to how valuable it really is. Especially considering how much I think my time is worth. Great read.

8. What I Wish I knew before I learned to code
    - Keri Savoca

                I wish I knew that everyone learns differently.
                    It was disheartening to watch some of my peers build professional-looking applications in a single afternoon while I was still counting brackets. But it lifted my spirits when I mastered a concept that was causing everyone else grief and anxiety. We all learned differently, and in the end, we all relied on each other’s experiences.


                I wish I knew that it was okay to ask questions.
                    I felt bad every time I raised my hand (and I raised my hand very often). I looked around the room and saw that half of the class had the same questions, but the other half had tuned out. I felt like I was wasting everyone’s time, but I wasn’t. I made an investment in my future, and I gained nothing by keeping my questions to myself.

                I wish I knew that everyone brought a different skillset.
                    Some people were expert designers. Others were fluent in Python. Some were career changers who brought years of experience in non-technical fields, and along with that, realistic ideas for startups. Others had worked in IT for decades and just wanted a refresher. Everyone had something to contribute.

                I developed a deep appreciation for sharing works in progress.
                    I learned more from my classmates than from the digital resources I had been using to study. Seeing code that worked was just as helpful as seeing code that didn’t work.
                
                I learned to appreciate collaboration in education.
                    I used to be one of those people who ran away from group projects. I was wrong. It turns out that collaborating with other programmers allows you to build off of each other’s strengths, and that Github makes collaboration seamless. There is no “he said/she said”; it’s clear who contributed each component of a project.

                I learned to be comfortable with the unknown.
                    Some “challenges” didn’t have a solution. Other challenges had dozens of solutions. Some projects were self-explanatory. Others appeared to make no sense at all. I began to accept that the questions I had on day 1, while valid, were simply part of the unknown at that time.

                I wish I knew that this would be a lifelong journey.
                    Learning to code is not a race. Even senior-level software engineers are still learning something. This is one of the few fields where you can spend your entire life learning, and still not have learned it all. But this is also one of the few fields where you can use critical thinking skills to figure out something you don’t know instead of taking a class or watching a tutorial

            My Synopsis: We all learn at different speeds and differently. It is important to remember that those around you aren't better, or your enemies, or anything. They're just there, just like you. It's important to remember that because when the struggle comes, it's important to note that everyone is struggling. It's our job to figure things out.
