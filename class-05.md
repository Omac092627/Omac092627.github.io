HTML:
  Images:
    You should store images on a separate file within your site. 
    When adding images you need a:
      Image tag: is an empty element meaning it doesn't get a closing tag.

      Source tag: This tells the browser where to find it.

      Alt tag: this provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you can not see it.

      Title: You can use a title attribute with the image element to provid additional information about the image.

      Height: This specifies the height of the image. Goes in the Image tag.

      Width: Specifies the width of the image and also goes within the Image tag.

      
      Place images before your paragraph.
      In the middle of your paragraph. 
      Or at the end of your paragraph.

    Align images vertically:
      Top: This aligns first lign of surrounding text with top of image.

      Middle: This aligns the text with the middle of the image.

      Bottom: this aligns first lign of text with bottom of the image. (probably the preferred method)


    TEXT:
      text-transform is the property to change the case of text.

        Uppercase: causes the text to appear uppercase.

        Lowercase: causes the text to appear lowercase.

        Capitalize: capitalizes the first letter of every word.
      
      text-decoration:

        none: this removes any decoration already applied to the text.

        underline: this adds a line underneath the text.

        overline: this adds a line over the top of the text.

        line-through: this adds a line through words.

        blink: this animates the text to make it flash on and off (however this is generally frowned upon, as it is considered rather annoying)

        line-height: space between the lines
        letter-spacing: space between letters
        word-spacing: space between words

        text-align: left, right, center, justify

        vertical-align: aligns the text vertically

        text-indent: indents first line of text

        text-shadow: used to create a drop shadow behind the text

        :LINK, :VISITED - changes the color of link after visited

        hover, active, focus: these allow the user to interact with what they are viewing on your page.
