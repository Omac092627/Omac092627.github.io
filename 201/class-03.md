Javascript: Chapter 4 Decisions and Loops

Type coercision: Javascript runs data behind the scenes.

Falsy: values are teated as if false

truthy: values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table is true.

unary operator: returns a result with just one operand.

Loop checks a condition, if true a block of code will run.

For loop: if you need to run your code a specific number of times.

While loop: if you don't know how many times you need your code to run. The condition doesn't have to be a counter, it will run as long as needed.

Do while loop: is same as a while loop but always runs code in the brackets one time.

Loop counter:

Initialization:
  Create a variable and set it to 0
  var i = 0

Condition:
  i < 10
  Loop should run until counter reaches number

Update:
  i++
  every time the loop runs you add one to the counter.
