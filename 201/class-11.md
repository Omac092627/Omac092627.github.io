  The reading notes provided were about Images and Practical information.
    The image section described the different techniques in order to position images in the way that you want them to be structured. From background images, to centering them, sky's the limit.

    As for practical information. The information seemed to be geared toward understanding how your page can get more traffic and how you can track who is viewing your information. You can use an FTP to transfer your files from your IDE to a hosting site. There are more tools and tips but these were just some of the takeaways that I found useful.
