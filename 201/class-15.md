I thought this article was very informative and taught me a different way of viewing group work. From what I've gathered, we as humans naturally have groups that we "roll" with. Within those groups are dictums and rules that make the group stick together. The real root of the group however, is empathy. 

Empathy allows us to listen and relate to our teammates. This is incredibly important because work is work, but how that work is executed is crucial. People have different backgrounds, up-bringings, and so on. These factors come into play when you are tasked with delivering on an assignment and must communicate with people you don't really know.

Project Aristotle was interesting in that even Google -- a top level company -- has issues with group dynamics. Shocking to hear. Because they have all the data in the world. But that data is useless if not comprehended properly. What Google did was implement a new way using prior data to allow their teams to communicate effectively. 

My overall takeaway would be that while working with a team, it's best not to be on guard. By that I mean, get to know the people you are working with. If you understand the people and can have a somewhat relationship with those people, your life will be, no, your balance for work and life, will be better.
