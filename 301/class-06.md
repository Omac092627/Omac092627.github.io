NODE JS:

Node is built on google chrome's V8 Javascript Engine:
    The V8 engine is the open-source javascript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind andn is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

    Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it's a JavaScript runtime.
