    WEB SERVICES AND APIS:
        It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

    URL tells machines everything need to talk to each other. 

    POLYMORPHISM: A way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them. things like: get(book), set(book).

    Machines view data differently than people. Machines don't care about layout.
